                <p>This is a collection of work from my job at Miami University. I work in the study abroad department designing marketing material for a variety of programs and events.</p>

                <p>This is a brochure I did for the summer study abroad programs at Miami. The Department is trying to increase the enrollment this year. To accomplish this, they came to me to design a brochure to distribute to all the students. The problem was that I had a TON of information that I needed to fit onto this piece of paper.</p>

                <p>They wanted to highlight the Luxembourg programs the most, so that's why they were placed in the grey box. The rest of the information is organized by department.</p>
