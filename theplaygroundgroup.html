                        <p>The Playground Group is a professional consulting firm who focuses on creating positive and productive workplaces. They were started in 2009 and have worked with companies such as P&G, Lexis Nexis, The Great American Insurance Group and Xavier University. <br> <br> They asked me to help them reboot their brand and create a modern and strong visual identity.</p>

                            The design process for The Playground Group was a lot of fun. They wanted something modern and clean and I wanted to play on the whole "playground" theme. I did this with the blocks that you see on the left side of the logo. These blocks represent the 3 criterea that they use when they consult with fortune 500 companies.

                            Normally, I'm not a huge fan of square business cards UNLESS they mean something to the brand. So after designing the logo for The Playground Group I knew that I needed to pitch the idea to them. I mocked up a sample card to show them and they loved it. It features the same red as the blocks in the logo. In the bottom corner on the front, the logo has spot gloss to add some dynamic to it.

                            <p>Sometimes you'll find a brand in unusal places. It was a lot of fun to work with such a professional/clean brand yet try and incorporate their "fun" name into it. This invloved a lot of back and forth with the client tryign to nail the look that they wanted. I think that I did a good job producing a look that was both sleek and fun.</p>
